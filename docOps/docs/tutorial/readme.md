# Exploring IOTA Smart Contracts

This document is an introductory tutorial of the IOTA Smart Contract Platform
(ISCP) for developers.

The level of this document is technical. Its target audience is software
engineers who want to understand the ISCP, and the direction it is taking, in
order to develop their own dApps and/or contribute to the development of the
ISCP and Wasp nodes.

The approach in this tutorial is to introduce main concepts through writing
unit tests for several example smart contracts. We use a Go testing package 
codenamed [Solo](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/master/packages/solo) in all examples of the
tutorial.

Knowledge of Go programming and basic knowledge of Rust programming are 
prerequisites.
