# The Solo package

Solo is a Go package to write tests for IOTA smart contracts. It allows the
deployment of ISCP chains and smart contracts. It also provides a toolkit for
interaction with smart contracts, for manipulation of tokens and ledger accounts
in an environment that is almost identical to the distributed multi-chain
environment of the ISCP.

The Solo package and its GoDoc link [can be found here](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/master/packages/solo). 
The GoDocs provides a reference to all Solo calls which can be used in tests 
(not necessarily covered in this tutorial).

Smart contracts are notoriously isolated from the outside world. The effect of
the user interaction with a smart contract is normally only observed in its
state change. The approach in this tutorial is to explain all main concepts of
ISCP development through loading smart contracts into the _Solo_ tests, invoking
its functions and examining state changes.

ISCP is currently in active development, so things change and are less than
perfect. In the current stage the ISCP software is experimental. We expect
feedback from the community about hands-on experience. We also expect
contribution to the development of ISCP itself, including Rust/Wasm development
environment or, possibly, alternative VM implementations.

_Solo_ is not a toy environment. It allows developers to develop and test real
smart contracts and entire inter-chain protocols before deploying them on the
distributed network.

Please follow [the link](../misc/install.md) for installation instructions.

## First example

The following is an example of a _Solo_ test. It deploys a new chain and invokes
a function in the `root` contract.

The `root` contract always exists on any chain. So for this example there is no
need to deploy any new contract. The test log to the testing output the main
parameters of the chain, lists names and IDs of all four core contracts.

```go
func TestTutorial1(t *testing.T) {
    env := solo.New(t, false, false)
    chain := env.NewChain(nil, "ex1")
    
    chainID, chainOwnerID, coreContracts := chain.GetInfo()                      // calls view root::GetChainInfo
    require.EqualValues(t, len(core.AllCoreContractsByHash), len(coreContracts)) // all core contracts deployed by default
    
    t.Logf("chain ID: %s", chainID.String())
    t.Logf("chain owner ID: %s", chainOwnerID.String())
    for hname, rec := range coreContracts {
        t.Logf("    Core contract '%s': %s", rec.Name, coretypes.NewAgentID(chainID.AsAddress(), hname))
    }
}
```

The output of the test will be something like this:

```

```

The core contracts listed in the log (`_default`, `accounts`, `blob`, `blocklog`
, `eventlog`, `root`) are automatically deployed on each new chain. You can see
them listed in the test log together with their _contract IDs_.

The output fragment in the log `state transition #0 --> #1` means the state of
the chain has changed from block index 0 (the origin index of the empty state)
to block index 1. The state #0 is the empty origin state, the #1 always contains
all core smart contracts deployed on the chain as well as other variables of
chain, such as _chainID_ and _chain owner ID_.

The _chain ID_ and _chain owner ID_ are respectively ID of the deployed
chain `$/iGBuy2yPUpdjX8p8ZXoAkHeFhW7bkrR1dwavWB4CknMU` and the address (in the
form of _agent ID_) from which the chain was deployed:
`A/1ECjLLrXYpDKTgtFfft4rFUsd7qkaXQw1Worm4oESzKVi::00000000` (the prefixes `$/`
and `A/` indicate that what follow are a chain ID and an agent ID, respectively).
